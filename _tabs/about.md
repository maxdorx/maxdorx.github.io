# Hey ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m Osama.  

Iâ€™ve always been the kind of person who takes things apart just to see how they work. That habit followed me into tech â€” breaking, fixing, and re-building computers, networks, and servers until it finally became a career.  

Right now, I work as a **Senior Network Security Engineer**, looking after everything from firewalls and switches to servers and cloud platforms. I started out onsite, but these days Iâ€™m mostly based in Dubai, running a big chunk of enterprise infrastructure remotely.  

Outside of the day job, I keep myself busy with side projects and labs. Some days itâ€™s spinning up Cisco or Fortinet environments on EVE-NG, other days itâ€™s tinkering with Hyper-V clusters, backup servers, or automating stuff with scripts. I like experimenting with **servers, virtualization, monitoring stacks, and security tools** just as much as I do with pure networking.  

This site is where I drop all of that:  
- Notes, configs, and fixes I wish I had when I first hit the problem  
- Write-ups from my labs (the working ones and the disasters)  
- Security concepts Iâ€™m studying for exams like CCNP Security and CCIE  

When Iâ€™m not in the lab, Iâ€™m usually learning for the next certification, testing new tools, or exploring ways to turn my skills into projects that help people.  

If youâ€™re into networks, servers, or security, youâ€™ll probably find something familiar here.
