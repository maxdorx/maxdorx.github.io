# Hey 👋 I’m Osama.  

I’ve always been the kind of person who takes things apart just to see how they work. That habit followed me into tech — breaking, fixing, and re-building computers, networks, and servers until it finally became a career.  

Right now, I work as a **Senior Network Security Engineer**, looking after everything from firewalls and switches to servers and cloud platforms. I started out onsite, but these days I’m mostly based in Dubai, running a big chunk of enterprise infrastructure remotely.  

Outside of the day job, I keep myself busy with side projects and labs. Some days it’s spinning up Cisco or Fortinet environments on EVE-NG, other days it’s tinkering with Hyper-V clusters, backup servers, or automating stuff with scripts. I like experimenting with **servers, virtualization, monitoring stacks, and security tools** just as much as I do with pure networking.  

This site is where I drop all of that:  
- Notes, configs, and fixes I wish I had when I first hit the problem  
- Write-ups from my labs (the working ones and the disasters)  
- Security concepts I’m studying for exams like CCNP Security and CCIE  

When I’m not in the lab, I’m usually learning for the next certification, testing new tools, or exploring ways to turn my skills into projects that help people.  

If you’re into networks, servers, or security, you’ll probably find something familiar here.
