# About Me

Hey ðŸ‘‹, Iâ€™m Osama.  

Iâ€™ve been messing with computers since I was a kid â€” the kind who couldnâ€™t go a week without breaking something on purpose, just to figure out how to fix it later. That curiosity slowly grew into a love for **technology and security**.  

These days, I spend most of my time deep in **networking and cybersecurity labs**, building and breaking things, and writing about what I learn along the way.  

This site is my little corner of the internet where I:  
- Share notes, configs, and scripts Iâ€™ve written  
- Document my labs (the good, the bad, the broken ðŸ˜…)  
- Post blogs about security concepts that clicked for me  

When Iâ€™m not labbing, youâ€™ll find me hacking away on platforms like **HackTheBox**, or grinding toward the next certification milestone.  

If youâ€™re into networking, security, or just like watching someone learn out loud â€” welcome aboard ðŸš€.
