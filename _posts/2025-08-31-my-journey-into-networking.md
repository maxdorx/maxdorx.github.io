I was always fascinated by tech. I touched a computer for the first time when I was **10 years old**, and from then on, I had a habit:  
every week, I’d break something… and then spend hours figuring out how to fix it.  

That habit never left me. It actually turned into a skill.

## From Curiosity to Hacking  

I’ve always been drawn to **hacking** — the curiosity of how systems break, and more importantly, how they can be fixed or protected.  
The deeper I went down the rabbit hole, the more I realized something important.  

I came across this meme 👇 and it couldn’t be more true:

It hit me: before you can be great at cybersecurity, you **must** master networking.  
If you don’t understand how packets move, how routers forward, or how firewalls inspect — your “security” is just guesswork.

## The CCNA Milestone  

So I did it the right way.  
In **December 2023**, I earned my **CCNA**, which gave me the foundations I needed.  
From there, I didn’t stop — I pushed forward into:  
- **FortiGate certifications** (because firewalls are a battlefield)  
- **ISO 27001 Associate** (because security is more than just configs, it’s about frameworks too)  

And now I’m grinding toward **CCNP Security**, with **CCIE Security** as the ultimate goal.

## Playing on HackTheBox  

When I’m not labbing or studying, I like to test myself on **HackTheBox**.  
You can find my profile here: [HackTheBox — Osama](https://app.hackthebox.com/profile/1774484).  

It’s where I get to flex what I learn, break into boxes, and remind myself that theory is nothing without practice.

## Why I’m Writing Here  

This blog is my **learning journal**. I’ll be posting labs, configs, scripts, and lessons I wish someone had given me earlier.  

If you’re just starting out in security, here’s my one-liner for you:  
👉 **Don’t skip networking.** Master it first — security will make so much more sense.
