# About Me

Hey 👋, I’m Osama.  

I’ve been messing with computers since I was about **10 years old**.  
Back then, I had this unshakable habit: every week I’d break something on my PC, and then spend nights figuring out how to fix it.  
That cycle of *break → learn → fix* shaped me into who I am today.  

I’ve always been fascinated by **hacking**. But the deeper I went, the more I realized that real hacking isn’t about “cool tools” — it’s about **understanding how systems actually work**.  
At some point, I stumbled upon a meme (which I’ve put in my blog) that said:  

> *Before you learn cybersecurity, learn networking first.*  

That became my philosophy.  

So in **December 2023**, I earned my **CCNA**, then moved on to **FortiGate certs** and **ISO 27001 Associate**.  
Right now, I’m chasing down **CCNP Security** and aiming for the beast — **CCIE Security**.  

Outside of labs, I hack on **HackTheBox** ([here’s my profile](https://app.hackthebox.com/profile/1774484)) where I put theory into practice.  

This site is where I’ll share my journey:  
- Technical blogs  
- Network & security labs  
- Scripts and tools I use  
- Random notes I’d want if I was starting out again  

If you’re here, welcome. 🚀
