I was always fascinated by tech. I touched a computer for the first time when I was **very young**, and from then on, I had a habit:  
every week, I’d break something… and then spend hours figuring out how to fix it.  

That habit never left me. It actually turned into a skill.

## From Curiosity to Hacking  

I’ve always been drawn to **hacking** — the curiosity of how systems break, and more importantly, how they can be fixed or protected.  
The deeper I went down the rabbit hole, the more I realized something important.  

I came across this meme 👇 and it couldn’t be more true:

It hit me: before you can be great at cybersecurity, you **must** master networking.  
If you don’t understand how packets move, how routers forward, or how firewalls inspect — your “security” is just guesswork.

## My Professional Journey

My professional journey started in **Jan 2021**. First job was CRM support. After a month they made me **Team Lead IT Support**. Suddenly I was looking after 500+ users, fixing web and CRM issues, QA, automating data tasks, and dealing with phone/call/email support every single day. That was my crash course — solving problems fast and learning to keep things running without burning everything down.

In 2022 I shifted into **systems engineering**. More serious work: Microsoft 365, Azure, VPNs for banking clients. That’s where I started leaning into security, making sure traffic between sites stayed solid and private.  

Now I’m with Digital Auxilius. I started onsite, now fully remote in Dubai. I run pretty much the whole stack: firewalls, switches, servers, hybrid cloud, backups, monitoring. Built out SD-WAN across multiple ISPs, tightened things up for ISO 27001, and still break stuff on purpose just to figure it out better.

## The CCNA Milestone  

In **December 2023**, I finally earned my **CCNA**. For me, it wasn’t just a certificate — it was the moment networking stopped feeling like magic and started making sense. Routing tables, VLANs, access-lists… all the pieces clicked together. That foundation is what pushed me to take security seriously, because you can’t defend what you don’t understand.  

Since then I’ve been stacking more:  
- **FortiGate certifications** (firewalls are where the battles happen)  
- **ISO 27001 Associate** (because security isn’t only configs — it’s frameworks and policies too)
  
And now I’m grinding toward **CCNP Security**, with **CCIE Security** as the ultimate goal.

## Playing on HackTheBox  

When I’m not labbing or studying, I like to test myself on **HackTheBox**.  
You can find my profile here: [HackTheBox — Osama](https://app.hackthebox.com/profile/1774484).  

The first time I rooted a box, it felt like beating a game boss I’d been stuck on for days. Every challenge reminds me that theory is nothing without practice — and that persistence usually matters more than shortcuts.

## Why I’m Writing Here  

This blog is my **learning journal**. I’ll be posting labs, configs, scripts, lessons, and more.  

If you’re just starting out in security, here’s my one-liner for you:  
👉 **Don’t skip networking.** Master it first — security will make so much more sense.
